part of protobuf;

/// An `EventPlugin` receives callbacks when the fields of a [GeneratedMessage]
/// change.
///
/// A [GeneratedMessage] mixin can install a plugin by overriding the
/// [GeneratedMessage.eventPlugin] property. The intent is provide mechanism,
/// not policy; each mixin defines its own public API, perhaps using streams.
///
/// This is a low-level, synchronous API. Event handlers are called in the
/// middle of protobuf changes. To avoid exposing half-finished changes to user
/// code, plugins should buffer events and send them asynchronously. (See
/// `event_mixin.dart` for an example.)
abstract class EventPlugin {
  /// Initializes the plugin.
  ///
  /// [GeneratedMessage] calls this once in its constructors.
  void attach(GeneratedMessage parent);

  /// If false, [GeneratedMessage] will skip calls to event handlers.
  bool get hasObservers;

  /// Called before setting a field.
  ///
  /// For repeated fields, this will be called when the list is created.
  /// (For example in [GeneratedMessage.getField] and merge methods.)
  void beforeSetField(FieldInfo fi, Object? newValue);

  /// Called before clearing a field.
  void beforeClearField(FieldInfo fi);
