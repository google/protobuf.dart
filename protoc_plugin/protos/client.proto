  // In client libraries, each proto RPC corresponds to one or more methods
  // which the end user is able to call, and calls the underlying RPC.
  // Normally, this method receives a single argument (a struct or instance
  // corresponding to the RPC request object). Defining this field will
  // add one or more overloads providing flattened or simpler method signatures
  // in some languages.
  //
  // The fields on the method signature are provided as a comma-separated
  // string.
  //
  // For example, the proto RPC and annotation:
  //
  //   rpc CreateSubscription(CreateSubscriptionRequest)
  //       returns (Subscription) {
  //     option (google.api.method_signature) = "name,topic";
  //   }
  //
  // Would add the following Java overload (in addition to the method accepting
  // the request object):
  //
  //   public final Subscription createSubscription(String name, String topic)
  //
  // The following backwards-compatibility guidelines apply:
  //
  //   * Adding this annotation to an unannotated method is backwards
  //     compatible.
  //   * Adding this annotation to a method which already has existing
  //     method signature annotations is backwards compatible if and only if
  //     the new method signature annotation is last in the sequence.
  //   * Modifying or removing an existing method signature annotation is
  //     a breaking change.
  //   * Re-ordering existing method signature annotations is a breaking
  //     change.
