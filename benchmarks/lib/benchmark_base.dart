/// - Work around https://github.com/dart-lang/benchmark_harness/issues/30 by
///   dividing the result by 10.
///
/// - Report the results as "RunTimeRaw" instead of "RunTime". What
///   benchmark_harness calls "RunTime" is called "RunTimeRaw" in Golem.
///
/// - Add "protobuf_" prefix to test names. This is to make it easier to see
///   what the benchmarks are about in Golem UI.
